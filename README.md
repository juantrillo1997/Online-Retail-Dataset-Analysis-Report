# Portfolio Project: Online Retail Exploratory Data Analysis with Python

## Overview
In this project, we will step into the shoes of entry-level data analysts at an online retail company, helping interpret real-world data to make key business decisions.

## Case Study
We will be working with transactional data from an online retail store. The dataset contains information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps. Our task is to explore and analyze this dataset to gain insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products.

By conducting exploratory data analysis, we will identify patterns, outliers, and correlations in the data, allowing us to make data-driven decisions and recommendations to optimize the store's operations and improve customer satisfaction. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, we will uncover key trends, such as the busiest sales months, best-selling products, and the store's most valuable customers. Ultimately, this project aims to provide actionable insights that can drive strategic business decisions and enhance the store's overall performance in the competitive online retail market.
